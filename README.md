## My process
Followed Abdul Khalid from FEM advice on last project I made sure to only use semantic elements in html. I including a CSS reset by Andy Bell. I used custom css properties(variables) for 
the colors. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learnt the importance of semantic html, more figma usage and the use of overlays on hover state.


### Continued development

I realize I need more practice with css grid,figma,BEM,overlays
